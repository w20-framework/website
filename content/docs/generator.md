To create a new W20 project from scratch, you need to have [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org) installed. 
To create a W20 application, run the following command:

```plain
npm install -g yo bower grunt-cli gulp generator-w20
yo w20
```

{{% callout info %}}
This will install the `yo`, `bower`, `grunt-cli`, `gulp` and `generator-w20` NPM packages globally. You may prefer to
install some locally (in the project directory) by removing the `-g` option. The generator is based on [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io/).  
{{% /callout %}}

# Result

If the process is successful, you should see a structure similar to the following:

```plain
- bower_components       <-- dependencies
      
- fragments              <-- application fragments (one per directory)
    - ...
    
- bower.json
- index.html             <-- application master page
- w20.app.json           <-- application configuration
```
